I am currently working in the BYU Multiple Agent Intelligent Coordination and Control [(MAGICC) Lab](https://magicc.byu.edu) as a research assistant. I started in this position in April 2025 as a part of the [IMMERSE Program](https://immerse.byu.edu/about-immerse) under Dr. James Usevitch.

As a research asisstant I have researched machine learning, safety, and control theory using tools in the Rust ecosystem. I am currently contributing to the RustFlight project, a Rust-based port of the [ROSflight](https://rosflight.org) project firmware designed for safety and adaptability.
